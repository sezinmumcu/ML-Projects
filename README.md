# ML-projects
This repository contains three machine learning projects, including regression analysis, classification models, and unsupervised learning methods. It features implementations of linear models, tree-based algorithms, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques using Python and sci-kit.

## Overview

This portfolio showcases my skills in:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Linear and regularized regression models
- Classification using traditional and tree-based methods
- Unsupervised learning methods including clustering
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering and selection
